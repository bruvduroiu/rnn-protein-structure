# Predicting Protein Secondary Structure using RNN & CNN

Model tested on the [CB513 dataset](https://www.princeton.edu/~jzthree/datasets/ICML2014/).

## Motivation

To build a RNN-based neural network model capable of predicting the secondary structure of proteins based on their amino-acid chains.

## Model architecture
